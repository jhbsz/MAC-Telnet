MAC-Telnet / MAC SSH for OpenWrt
==============================

This is a fork of [MAC-Telnet](https://github.com/aouyar/MAC-Telnet) which
is an SSH-enabled version of the original MAC-Telnet implementation from
[haakonnessjoen](https://github.com/haakonnessjoen) (_Håkon Nessjøen_).

The fork reworks the mactelnet codebase to built upon uloop, usock and
other facilities provided by the standard OpenWrt libraries.
